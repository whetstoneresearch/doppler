## Burnout Risk Assessment: [Name]

**Date:** [Date]
**Data Source:** [PDF/JSON]
**Pattern:** [Archetype]

### Energy Utilization

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Survey EU | [value] |
| Job EU | [value] |
| **Utilization** | **[Job/Survey × 100]%** |

### Status Classification

| Range | Status | This Person |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 70-130% | Healthy | [ ] |
| >130% | **STRESS** (burnout risk) | [ ] |
| <70% | **FRUSTRATION** (flight risk) | [ ] |

**Current Status:** [Healthy/Stress/Frustration]

### Arrow Movement

| Graph | Arrow Position | Delta |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Survey | [value] | - |
| Job | [value] | [±X] |

**Interpretation:** [Arrow moved right = stress / Arrow moved left = frustration / No movement = stable]

### Trait Modification Analysis

| Trait | Survey | Job | Change | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|-----|--------|----------------|
| A | [pos from arrow] | [pos from arrow] | [±X] | [meaning] |
| B | [pos from arrow] | [pos from arrow] | [±X] | [meaning] |
| C | [pos from arrow] | [pos from arrow] | [±X] | [meaning] |
| D | [pos from arrow] | [pos from arrow] | [±X] | [meaning] |

### Most Significant Modifications

1. **[Trait]:** [Survey pos] → [Job pos] ([interpretation])
2. **[Trait]:** [Survey pos] → [Job pos] ([interpretation])

### Red Flags Detected

| Signal | Present | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| EU 0-10 (avoidant) | [Y/N] | [details] |
| All dots flipped sides | [Y/N] | [details] |
| D raised significantly | [Y/N] | [details] |
| Arrow shifted >2 positions | [Y/N] | [details] |
| Utilization >150% | [Y/N] | [details] |
| Utilization <50% | [Y/N] | [details] |

### Risk Assessment

| Factor | Finding | Risk Level |
|--------|---------|------------|
| EU Utilization | [%] | [Low/Medium/High/Critical] |
| Trait Modifications | [summary] | [Low/Medium/High/Critical] |
| Arrow Movement | [summary] | [Low/Medium/High/Critical] |
| **Overall Risk** | - | **[Low/Medium/High/Critical]** |

### Root Cause Hypothesis

Based on the modification pattern, likely causes include:

1. **[Cause 1]:** [explanation based on specific trait changes]
2. **[Cause 2]:** [explanation based on specific trait changes]

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate (if High/Critical):**
- [ ] [Immediate action]
- [ ] [Immediate action]

**Short-term:**
- [ ] [Short-term action]
- [ ] [Short-term action]

**Ongoing:**
- [ ] [Ongoing monitoring action]

### Questions to Explore

2. [Question to ask in 1:1 based on modifications]
3. [Question to ask in 1:1 based on modifications]

### Resurvey Recommendation

| Current Risk | Resurvey In |
|--------------|-------------|
| Low | 6 months |
| Medium | 3 months |
| High | 1-2 months |
| Critical | After intervention |
