### Areas to Verify with Actual CI

When the actual Culture Index survey is administered after offer acceptance, pay special attention to:

1. **[Trait]:** Predicted [position] at [confidence] - verify this prediction
2. **[Trait]:** [Specific uncertainty to verify]
3. **[Any trait critical for role fit]**

### Important Caveats

- **This is a prediction, not a diagnosis.** Interview behavior may differ from natural behavior.
- **Interview stress affects presentation.** Some traits may be masked or amplified.
- **Actual CI survey will be administered** after offer is signed and before start date.
- **Use for preliminary assessment only.** Do not treat predictions as definitive.
- **Technical skills, experience, and culture fit** still matter independently of CI.
