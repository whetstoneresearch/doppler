<overview>

Secondary traits (EU, L, I) supplement the primary traits. L and I are unique: they use **absolute values** and CAN be compared directly between people.

</overview>

<trait name="EU" label="Energy Units">

Measures **mental stamina** - how long a person can work before needing a short 5-10 minute mental break to recharge. If they don't take that break, they operate in a mentally fatigued state (frustrated, lacking clarity, missing things).

<important_note>
EU is NOT:
- Physical energy
- Work ethic
- Intelligence or capability
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Range | Label | Management Approach |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| 0-10 | **Potentially avoidant** | Flag for review - may need hand-scoring |
| 11-19 | Lower EU | Prioritize important work first thing in morning, earlier in week |
| 20-40 | Most common for executives | Regular short breaks throughout day (4-5 per 10-hour day) |
| 41-60 | Above average | Longer sustained focus possible |
| 61-80 | High ("energizer bunnies") | As mentally fresh at 9pm as 9am; watch for late-night emails |

</interpretation>

<avoidant_responses>

If EU is 0-10, flag for review. Common causes:
1. Didn't read instructions - selected one word per column
2. Interrupted before completing
3. Took survey in non-native language
4. Overly guarded/skeptical - trust issue ("How will this be used against me?")
5. Below 8th grade reading level

**If multiple direct reports return avoidant:** Look at the manager - "Why do you have a culture of fear or mistrust?"

</avoidant_responses>

<energy_drain>

**Critical insight**: Living in your TOP graph (natural traits) does NOT drain EU - it's effortless.

What DRAINS EU is behavior modification - when your bottom graph differs from your top graph, you're expending mental energy to "act" differently than you're wired.

</energy_drain>

<utilization_formula>

**Compare EU between Survey and Job using:**

```
Energy Utilization = (Job EU / Survey EU) × 100
```

| Utilization | Signal | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 70-130% | Healthy | Sustainable workload alignment |
| >130% | **STRESS** | Good stress (self-induced caring) OR bad stress (overutilization). Burnout risk. |
| <70% | **FRUSTRATION** | Disengaged, apathetic, going through motions, underutilized, bored. **Flight risk.** |

**Example**: Survey EU = 41, Job EU = 31. Utilization = 31/41 = 75%. Approaching check-engine-light zone for frustration/disengagement.

</utilization_formula>

<stress_types>

**>130% Stress Types:**
- **Good stress (self-induced)**: "I really care about this company, I love what I do" - but still potential for burnout and health issues if sustained 3-6 months
- **Bad stress (overutilization)**: Loaded with too much work, or work requires too much behavior modification

**<70% Frustration:** Work doesn't quite fit them. Might have a lot to do, but the work doesn't match their traits. Not punching eject yet, but getting close.

</stress_types>

<resurvey_cadence>

Job behaviors should be resurveyed biannually. Don't make decisions on stale data (18+ months old).

</resurvey_cadence>

</trait>

<trait name="L" color="purple" label="Logic">

Measures how a person receives and processes new information - the first filter when receiving new information, especially sensitive information. **Also measures self-esteem** - the lower the logic, the lower the self-esteem.

<important_note>
L uses **absolute values**. You CAN compare L scores directly between people.
Logic 8 means "High Logic" regardless of arrow position.
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Score | Label | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | Low Logic | Emotional, sensitive, heartfelt, passionate; emotions filter information first |
| 3-7 | Normative | Emotionally available competency - balanced head and heart working in tandem |
| 8-10 | High Logic | Rational, logical, black/white; high emotional compartmentalization; detach in the moment |

</interpretation>

<low_logic range="0-2">

**Characteristics:**
- Lack emotional control in the moment - first response may be chemically induced, not fact-based
- Introduces unpredictability - irrational in-the-moment decision making
- Can have high self-confidence (A) but low self-esteem simultaneously

**Benefit:** Emotional attachment can drive extraordinary results (Olympians, entrepreneurs)

**Managing Low Logic:**
- Don't say "calm down"
- Create distance - "Let's talk at 4pm today"
- They'll meet you as an adult once emotions settle

</low_logic>

<normative_logic range="3-7">

- Natural EQ - emotionally available but not governed by emotions
- 3-4: Lead more heart than head, but not disconnected from rational thought
- 5: Dead smack in the middle
- 6-7: Lead more head than heart

</normative_logic>

<high_logic range="8-10">

**Characteristics:**
- Clear thinking when things are hitting the fan
- Complete separation from emotions; tough situations don't phase them

**Watch:** Can come across cold, detached, insensitive. "Toughens the dots up."

**Combination note:** High B + Logic 10 = outgoing but can say insensitive things (a bit of an "ahole factor")

**Combination note:** Low B + Logic 10 = "sensitivity is not going to be your strong suit"

</high_logic>

<job_behavior_signal>

When a high logic person (9-10) drops their logic in job behaviors (to 4-5), it's almost always an indication of **people-related challenges**. They're trying to be more emotionally open because they've been told they're too cold/detached.

</job_behavior_signal>

</trait>

<trait name="I" color="cyan" label="Ingenuity">

Measures raw inventiveness and spatial reasoning - how detached from reality someone thinks. "Clever or original thinking."

<important_note>
I uses **absolute values**. You CAN compare I scores directly between people.
Ingenuity 8 means "High Ingenuity" regardless of arrow position.
</important_note>

<interpretation>

| Score | Label | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | Low Ingenuity | **Most common score**. Linear, practical, grounded. If it doesn't exist, need to touch/see/feel/experience it. |
| 3-6 | Occasional | Occasional moments of inspiration - looking at things in a more layered, original way. |
| 7-10 | High Ingenuity | Ingenious, inventive, eccentric, multidimensional thinkers. Detached from reality. |

</interpretation>

<the_pen_test>

Ask what a pen is:
- Low ingenuity (0-2): "It's a pen."
- High ingenuity (9): "It's how we pump oil in Texas. A window into another world. Executive decision-making. A weapon."
- Low ingenuity response to high ingenuity: "No, moron. It's a freaking pen."

</the_pen_test>

<high_ingenuity range="7-10">

**Where it helps:**
- New business lines and revenue opportunities
- Creative proposals
- R&D
- Creative marketing
- Don't see limitations - experimental, try unconventional approaches

**Watch for:**
- Can be distracting with constant weird ideas
- Not all ideas monetizable - need A trait to commercialize
- Especially disruptive if in position to initiate ideas

</high_ingenuity>

<low_ingenuity range="0-2">

**Most common score.** Not a negative - indicates practical, grounded thinking.

**Note:** Single-tail IQ correlation. High I → likely high IQ. However, low I does NOT mean low IQ - plenty of certified geniuses have low ingenuity scores.

</low_ingenuity>

<job_behavior_signal>

When a low ingenuity person raises their ingenuity in job behaviors, the traditional approach is not working. They're trying to figure out a more inventive way to handle something they're stuck on.

</job_behavior_signal>

</trait>

<confidence_sources>

Culture Index identifies three sources of confidence, each tied to a trait:

| Trait | Confidence Source | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| High A | Inner self-confidence | Belief in self regardless of circumstances. "I believe I'll win." Can be in a hitting slump and picks themselves up by bootstraps. |
| High B | Social confidence | Confidence from ability to influence and connect. If people don't respond, starts questioning self. High A + High B can fall back on A's self-confidence. |
| High D | Knowledge/Expertise confidence | "If I know it, I know it." Confidence rooted in mastery and competency. Great vetters. |

**Confidence recovery:**
- High A's recover by getting back in the winner's circle (stack easy wins)
- High B's recover through relationship reconnection
- High D's recover through acquiring more knowledge/training

</confidence_sources>
