# Static Analysis

A comprehensive static analysis toolkit with CodeQL, Semgrep, and SARIF parsing for security vulnerability detection.

CodeQL and Semgrep skills are based on the Trail of Bits Testing Handbook:

- [CodeQL Testing Handbook](https://appsec.guide/docs/static-analysis/codeql/)
- [Semgrep Testing Handbook](https://appsec.guide/docs/static-analysis/semgrep/)

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `codeql`        | Deep security analysis with taint tracking and data flow |
| `semgrep`       | Fast pattern-based security scanning                     |
| `sarif-parsing` | Parse and process results from static analysis tools     |

## When to Use

Use this plugin when you need to:
- Perform security vulnerability detection on codebases
- Run CodeQL for interprocedural taint tracking and data flow analysis
- Use Semgrep for fast pattern-based bug detection
- Parse SARIF output from security scanners
- Set up static analysis in CI/CD pipelines
- Aggregate and deduplicate findings from multiple tools

## What It Does

### CodeQL
- Create databases for Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, C/C++, and more
- Run security queries with SARIF/CSV output
- Write custom QL queries with taint tracking
- Integrate with GitHub Actions

### Semgrep
- Quick security scans using built-in rulesets (OWASP, CWE, Trail of Bits)
- Write custom YAML rules with pattern matching
- Taint mode for tracking data flow from sources to sinks
- CI/CD integration with baseline scanning

### SARIF Parsing
- Understand SARIF 2.1.0 structure
- Quick analysis using jq for CLI queries
- Python scripting with pysarif and sarif-tools
- Aggregate and deduplicate results from multiple files
- CI/CD integration patterns
