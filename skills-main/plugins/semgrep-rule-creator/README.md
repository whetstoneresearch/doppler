## When to Use

Use this plugin when you need to:
- Create custom Semgrep rules for detecting specific bug patterns
- Write rules for security vulnerability detection
- Build taint-mode rules for data flow analysis
- Develop pattern-matching rules for code quality checks

## What It Does

- Guides test-driven rule development (write tests first, then iterate)
- Analyzes AST structure to help craft precise patterns
- Supports both taint mode (data flow) and pattern matching approaches
- Includes comprehensive reference documentation from Semgrep docs
- Provides common vulnerability patterns by language

## Prerequisites

- [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) installed (`pip install semgrep` or `brew install semgrep`)
