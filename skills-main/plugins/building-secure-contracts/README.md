## Development Guidelines Assistants

Based on Trail of Bits' [Development Guidelines](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/development-guidelines).

### Audit Prep Assistant
**Skill:** `/audit-prep-assistant`

Prepare your codebase for security reviews with a comprehensive checklist:
1. **Set review goals** - Define objectives and concerns
2. **Resolve easy issues** - Run static analysis (Slither, dylint, golangci-lint)
3. **Ensure accessibility** - Build instructions, frozen commits, scope clarity
4. **Generate documentation** - Flowcharts, user stories, glossaries

**Use this:** 1-2 weeks before your audit to maximize review effectiveness.

### Code Maturity Assessor
**Skill:** `/code-maturity-assessor`

Systematic code maturity evaluation using Trail of Bits' 9-category framework:
- Arithmetic safety
- Auditing practices
- Authentication/Access controls
- Complexity management
- Decentralization
- Documentation quality
- Transaction ordering risks
- Low-level manipulation
- Testing and verification

**Output:** Professional maturity scorecard with evidence-based ratings and improvement roadmap.

### Guidelines Advisor
**Skill:** `/guidelines-advisor`

Comprehensive development best practices advisor covering:
- **Documentation & Specifications** - Generate system descriptions and architectural diagrams
- **Architecture Analysis** - Optimize on-chain/off-chain distribution
- **Upgradeability Review** - Assess upgrade patterns and delegatecall proxies
- **Implementation Quality** - Review functions, inheritance, events
- **Common Pitfalls** - Identify security anti-patterns
- **Dependencies** - Evaluate library usage
- **Testing** - Suggest improvements

**Use this:** Throughout development for architectural and implementation guidance.

### Secure Workflow Guide
**Skill:** `/secure-workflow-guide`

Interactive 5-step secure development workflow:
1. **Known Security Issues** - Run Slither with 70+ detectors
2. **Special Features** - Check upgradeability, ERC conformance, token integration
3. **Visual Inspection** - Generate inheritance graphs, function summaries, authorization maps
4. **Security Properties** - Document properties, set up Echidna/Manticore
5. **Manual Review** - Analyze privacy, front-running, cryptography, DeFi risks

**Use this:** On every check-in or before deployment for continuous security validation.

### Token Integration Analyzer
**Skill:** `/token-integration-analyzer`

Comprehensive token security analysis for both implementations and integrations:
- **ERC20/ERC721 Conformity** - Validate standard compliance
- **Contract Composition** - Assess complexity and SafeMath usage
- **Owner Privileges** - Review upgradeability, minting, pausability, blacklists
- **20+ Weird Token Patterns** - Check for non-standard behaviors (missing returns, fee-on-transfer, rebasing, etc.)
- **On-chain Analysis** - Query deployed contracts for scarcity and distribution
- **Integration Safety** - Verify defensive patterns and safe transfer usage

**Use this:** When building tokens or integrating with external tokens.

## Tool Integration

Many skills leverage security tools when available:
- **Slither** - Static analysis for Solidity (70+ detectors, visual diagrams, upgradeability checks)
- **Echidna** - Property-based fuzzing
- **Manticore** - Symbolic execution
- **Tealer** - Static analyzer for TEAL/PyTeal
- **Web3/Ethers** - On-chain queries for deployed contracts

**Note:** Skills gracefully adapt when tools are unavailable, performing manual analysis instead.
