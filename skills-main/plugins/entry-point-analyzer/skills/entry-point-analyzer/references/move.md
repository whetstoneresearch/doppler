# Move Entry Point Detection (Aptos/Sui)

## Entry Point Identification (State-Changing Only)

In Move, `entry` functions are designed for transactions and typically modify state. **Include all entry functions** by default, as they represent the attack surface. Pure `public fun` (non-entry) functions are module-callable only and excluded.

### Aptos Move
```move
// Public entry functions are entry points
public entry fun transfer(from: &signer, to: address, amount: u64) { }

// Public functions callable by other modules
public fun helper(): u64 { }

// Entry-only functions (can't be called by other modules)
entry fun private_entry(account: &signer) { }
```

### Sui Move
```move
// Entry functions in Sui
public entry fun transfer(ctx: &mut TxContext) { }

// Public functions
public fun compute(): u64 { }
```

### Visibility Rules
| Visibility | Include? | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| `public entry fun` | **Yes** | Transaction entry point (state-changing) |
| `entry fun` | **Yes** | Transaction-only entry point |
| `public fun` | No | Module-callable only, not direct entry |
| `fun` (private) | No | Not externally callable |
| `public(friend) fun` | No | Friend modules only |

## Access Control Patterns

### Signer-Based Control (Aptos)
```move
// Admin check via signer
public entry fun admin_action(admin: &signer) {
    assert!(signer::address_of(admin) == @admin_address, E_NOT_ADMIN);
}

// Owner check via resource
public entry fun owner_action(owner: &signer) acquires Config {
    let config = borrow_global<Config>(@module_addr);
    assert!(signer::address_of(owner) == config.owner, E_NOT_OWNER);
}
```

### Capability Pattern (Aptos)
```move
// Capability resource
struct AdminCap has key, store {}

// Requires capability
public entry fun admin_action(admin: &signer) acquires AdminCap {
    assert!(exists<AdminCap>(signer::address_of(admin)), E_NO_CAP);
}
```

### Sui Object Ownership
```move
// Object ownership provides access control
public entry fun use_owned_object(obj: &mut MyObject, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
    // Only owner of obj can call this
}

// Shared objects - anyone can access
public entry fun use_shared(obj: &mut SharedObject) { }
```

### Access Control Classification
| Pattern | Classification |
|---------|----------------|
| `signer::address_of(s) == @admin` | Admin |
| `signer::address_of(s) == config.owner` | Owner |
| `exists<AdminCap>(addr)` | Admin (capability) |
| `exists<GovernanceCap>(addr)` | Governance |
| `exists<GuardianCap>(addr)` | Guardian |
| Owned object parameter | Owner of object |
| Shared object, no signer check | Public (Unrestricted) |
| `&signer` with no checks | Review Required |

## Contract-Only Detection

### Friend Functions
```move
// Only callable by friend modules
public(friend) fun internal_callback() { }

// Friend declaration
friend other_module;
```

### Module-to-Module Patterns
```move
// Functions designed for other modules
public fun on_transfer_hook(amount: u64): bool {
    // Called by token module
}
```

## Extraction Strategy

### Aptos
1. Parse all `.move` files
2. Find `module` declarations
3. Extract functions with `public entry` or `entry` visibility
4. Check function body for:
   - `signer::address_of` comparisons → Role-based
   - `exists<*Cap>` checks → Capability-based
   - No access checks → Public (Unrestricted)

### Sui
1. Parse all `.move` files
2. Find `module` declarations
3. Extract `public entry` and `entry` functions
4. Analyze parameters:
   - Owned object types → Owner-restricted
   - Shared objects without signer → Public
   - `&signer`/`&mut TxContext` with checks → Role-based

## Move-Specific Considerations

1. **Resource Model**: Access control often through resource ownership
2. **Capabilities**: `Cap` suffix typically indicates capability pattern
3. **Acquires**: `acquires Resource` shows what global resources are accessed
4. **Generic Types**: Type parameters may carry capability constraints
5. **Friend Visibility**: `public(friend)` limits callers to declared friends

## Common Gotchas

1. **Init Functions**: `init` or `initialize` often create initial capabilities
2. **Object Wrapping (Sui)**: Wrapped objects transfer ownership
3. **Shared vs Owned (Sui)**: Shared objects have different access semantics
4. **Module Upgrades**: Check upgrade capability ownership
5. **Phantom Types**: Type parameters with `phantom` don't affect runtime
