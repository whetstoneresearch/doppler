## Overview

The `StreamableFeesLockerV2` allows the locking of Uniswap V4 LP tokens after the migration of an auction pool for a specific duration. During this period, the fees generated by the locked LP tokens can be streamed to designated beneficiaries. This contract can be used to make sure liquidity is locked for a certain period while still allowing fee collection.
